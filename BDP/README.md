## Objectives

1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns;
2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system;
3. Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.

## Some Theory

## Main task

1. By extending your project, implement as many behavioral design patterns as you need in your project:
    * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
    * The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
    * The behavioral DPs can be integrated into you functionalities alongside the structural ones;
    * There should only be one client for the whole system;
2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):
    * client;
    * domain;
    * utilities;
    * data(if applies);
3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):
   * Topic of the laboratory work;
   * Author;
   * Introduction/Theory/Motivation;
   * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well):
   * Indicate the location of the code snippet;
   * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern;
   * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;
